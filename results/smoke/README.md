### Smoke Tests

This folder contains outputs from **quick smoke-test runs** — short/debug runs with minimal configurations.  
They are primarily used to verify that the end-to-end pipeline works as expected.  

### Files
- `config_snapshot_*.json` – configuration snapshots used in smoke tests.  
- `*_smoke_*.csv/md` – quick test logs and summary results.  
- `README.md` – this file.  

### Notes
- These files are **not used** in dissertation analysis or final results.  
- Kept only for provenance, to show the development/debugging history of the pipeline.  
- Safe to ignore for evaluation and interpretation.
