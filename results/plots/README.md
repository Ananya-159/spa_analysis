### Plots

This folder contains processed **figures** generated by the batch plotting scripts and second-round reallocation analysis.  
Figures include boxplots, histograms, convergence curves, fairness plots, and statistical comparison visualizations.

### Subfolders

- **Genetic_algorithm/**  
  All GA plots from `plot_ga_batch.py`, `plot_ga_run.py` and `analyze_ga_stats.py`.  
  Includes performance distributions, convergence curves, fairness, and summary comparisons.

- **Hill_climbing/**  
  All HC plots from `plot_hc_batch.py`, `plot_hc_run.py` and `analyze_hc_stats.py`.
  Includes analogous outputs to GA (distribution plots, convergence, fairness).

- **Second_round_hill_climbing/**  
  Plots illustrating the **impact of the second round** (swap-only HC reallocation step).  
  Each set of plots is tagged with run information (e.g., `modeB_*`).  
  Includes:  
  1. **Impact Pie** – Improved / Unchanged / Worsened students.  
  2. **Top-1 / Top-3 Satisfaction** – % of affected students matched before vs after.  
  3. **Assigned Preference Rank Distribution** – Side-by-side bars for each rank.  
  4. **Average Preference Rank** – Cohort vs affected students (before vs after).  

- **selector_hill_climbing/**  
  Plots generated from `plot_selector_hc_batch.py` (batch runs) and `plot_selector_hc_run.py` (single run) and `analyze_selector_hc_stats.py`.  
  Includes convergence plots, fairness–violation trade-offs, operator usage, and allocation quality breakdowns.

- **statistical_comparison/**  
  Comparative plots across **GA vs HC vs Selector-based HC**.  
  Includes boxplots, strip plots, scatterplots, and traffic-light style heatmaps.

### Usage

- These plots are used to **visualize algorithm behavior** (GA, HC, Selector HC) and the **policy effect of second-round allocations**.  
- Plots correspond to allocations in:  
  - `results/Genetic_algorithm_runs/`  
  - `results/Hill_climbing_runs/`  
  - `results/selector_hill_climbing_runs/`  
  - `results/Second_round_allocations/`  
- Summaries are provided in `results/summary/` (logs and statistical reports).
