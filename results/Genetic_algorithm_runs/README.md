### Genetic Algorithm Runs

This folder contains raw **CSV logs and allocation files** for Genetic Algorithm (GA) batch runs (typically 30 seeds).

### Files

- `ga_summary_log.csv` → cumulative log across runs.  
- `convergence_ga_*.csv` → per-generation convergence logs.  
- `*_ga_alloc_*.csv` → final allocation files (best solution per run).  
- `README.md`→ this file.

### Note

Do not edit these files manually. They are auto-generated by `ga_main.py`.
