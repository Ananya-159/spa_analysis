### Second Round Allocations (Hill Climbing)

This folder contains **per-student allocation CSVs** generated by the **second-round reallocation step**.

### Files

- `*_second_round_alloc.csv` - Final allocation of students after applying the second round (HC swap-only when no new project capacity is available).  
  Each row = one student with:  
  - `Student ID`  
  - `Assigned Project`  
  - `Matched Preference Rank`  
  - `OutOfList` flag  
  - Additional diagnostic flags (if any).  

- `*_second_round_log.csv` - Detailed run log with constraint violations, fitness, runtime, Gini satisfaction, and per-run metadata. 
- `README.md`→ this file. 


### Notes

- File names are timestamped in UTC (e.g., `2025-08-21T19-23-31Z_second_round_alloc.csv`).  
- Can use these allocations for **micro-level inspection** (who was reassigned, what changed).  
- Companion plots are stored under `results/plots/Second_round_hill_climbing`.  
- Aggregated run summaries are appended automatically to:  
  - `results/summary/second_round_summary_log.csv` → HC-style summary row.  
  - `results/summary/second_round_stats.csv` → paired tests (Within one run, per-student paired tests).
