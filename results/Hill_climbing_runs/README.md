### Hill Climbing Runs

This folder contains raw **CSV logs and allocation files** for Hill Climbing (HC) batch runs (typically 30 seeds).

### Files

- `hc_summary_log.csv` → cumulative log across runs.  
- `convergence_hc_*.csv` → per-generation convergence logs.  
- `*_hc_alloc_*.csv` → final allocation files (best solution per run).  
- `README.md`→ this file.

### Note

Do not edit these files manually. They are auto-generated by `hc_main.py`.
